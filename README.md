# College-Notice-Event-Portal
This project presents a web-based College Notice and Event Portal designed to replace traditional physical notice boards and manual communication methods in educational institutions. The system allows administrators to publish important announcements and upcoming events, while students can conveniently access them anytime through a web browser. The problem addressed is the delay, inaccessibility, and information loss that occurs when notices are restricted to physical boards. To solve this, the portal provides a centralized digital platform with real-time updates. Key features include secure login authentication, role-based access for admin and students, notice posting, event creation, search functionality, dark mode, and animated background interface. 

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Firebase Authentication, and Cloud Firestore for database storage. The final outcome is an interactive, responsive, and user-friendly system that improves communication efficiency, reduces paper usage, and ensures that students never miss important updates.
